* microdata/RDFa-Lite library:

 - Light weight streaming parser
   - Parse chunked html and microdata/RDFa-Lite events are passed
     via callback handlers
   - Applications can reduce memory foot print because
     huge HTML tree internally isn't internally created

 - Data model builder
   - Create a data model based on the underlying streaming parser result
   - All semantics of microdata/RDFa-Lite can be accessed via HTML5 microdata API

* How to build binary:

 1. Install libxml because the streaming parser works on libxml HTMLparser

 2. Execute configure script
    $ ./configure

 3. Build library
    $ make
    
* How to serialize API specification:

 1. Install doxygen

 2. Execute doxygen command under $LIBRARY_ROOT/csem
    $ doxygen
    
 3. API specification is serialized under $LIBRARY_ROOT/doc as both html and man
