* microdata/RDFa-Lite library:

 - Light weight streaming parser
   - Parse chunked HTML and extract both microdata[1]/RDFa-Lite[2] via
     corresponding event handlers
   - Applications can reduce memory foot print
     because huge HTML tree isn't internally created

 - Data model builder
   - Create a data model based on the underlying streaming parser result
   - All semantics of microdata/RDFa-Lite can be accessed via HTML5 microdata API

* How to build binary:

 1. Install libxml because the streaming parser works on libxml HTMLparser

 2. Execute configure script
    $ ./configure

 3. Build library
    $ make
    
* How to serialize API specification:

 1. Install doxygen

 2. Execute doxygen command under $LIBRARY_ROOT/csem
    $ doxygen
    
 3. API specification is serialized under $LIBRARY_ROOT/doc as both html and man
 
* Sample programs

 - Examples for each module can be found under $LIBRARY_ROOT/examples
 - A sample program based on Chrome extension [3]

* Code quality

 - No memory leak with valgrind
 - Nice code coverage (more than 80%)

* Related prototypes [4]
